## üß† **What is Layer Prompting?**

**Layer Prompting** is EnfusionAIze's proprietary methodology for structuring AI interactions across multiple cognitive layers to achieve optimal business outcomes. This systematic approach ensures consistent, high-quality results while maximizing AI model effectiveness.

Unlike traditional prompting techniques that rely on single-shot instructions, Layer Prompting creates a structured framework that mirrors human cognitive processes, resulting in more sophisticated and reliable AI outputs.

### **Core Principles:**

1. **Cognitive Layering** - Mirrors human problem-solving processes
2. **Systematic Structure** - Ensures consistency and reproducibility
3. **Context Preservation** - Maintains information across interactions
4. **Quality Assurance** - Built-in validation and error checking
5. **Scalable Implementation** - Works across all AI models and use cases
