## Week 3: Integrated Project

### Final Challenge: Programmatic SEO Workflow
Execute the complete programmatic SEO pipeline for a sandbox domain:

1. **Discovery Phase**

   use perplexity mcp to find programmatic keyword ideas for [your niche]
   use dataforseo mcp to enrich keyword list with volume and difficulty
   ```

2. **PRD Generation**
   ```
   reference summary.md and keyword_volume.csv to create product requirement document
   prioritize AI tool comparison keywords
   ```

3. **Implementation**
   ```
   claude: find programmatic-seo-comparison-prd.md, plan and build page templates
   push to production: /vercel deploy --prod
   ```

4. **SEO Audit & Fix**
   ```
   use firecrawl mcp to audit deployed site and fix technical SEO issues
   claude: implement fixes now
   ```

5. **Presentation**
