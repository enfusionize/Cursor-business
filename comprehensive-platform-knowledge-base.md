    const taskAnalysis = await this.analyzeTask(task);
    const modelScores = await this.scoreModels(taskAnalysis);
    
    return {
      primary: modelScores.best,
      fallback: modelScores.backup,
      reasoning: modelScores.explanation,
      estimatedCost: modelScores.cost,
      estimatedTime: modelScores.time
    };
  }
  
  scoreModels(taskAnalysis) {
    const models = ['claude', 'minimax', 'dora', 'emergent', 'orchids'];
    const scores = models.map(model => ({
      model: model,
      qualityScore: this.predictQuality(model, taskAnalysis),
      speedScore: this.predictSpeed(model, taskAnalysis),
      costScore: this.calculateCost(model, taskAnalysis),
      combinedScore: this.weightedScore(model, taskAnalysis)
    }));
    
    return scores.sort((a, b) => b.combinedScore - a.combinedScore);
  }
